export const aboutMe =
  "I am a student at Utah State University in my Senior year of a Computer Engineering Bachelor's. I have taken most mathematics, statistics and engineering classes required for my major. I chose computer vision and game development for my high-level computer science electives because I have strong interests in big data, computer vision, machine learning, neural networks and more! I have been working on several personal projects from a rock climbing tool comparison web app to a machine learning based in-game economy predictor. You can view the publicly shared projects at the bottom of this page."
